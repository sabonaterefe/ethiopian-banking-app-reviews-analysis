"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.",2,2025-05-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store,NEGATIVE,0.9997394680976868

this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store,NEGATIVE,0.9983141422271729

Taking away the screenshot of the receipt is just silly. Worse is tbe download button putting a copy of the screenshot - which you prevented to be taken - in tbe downloads folder where we cant attach directly from Whatsapp. Millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment / transfer yet you make that harder for everyone?

"Worst app possible, I don't think it gets worse than this. Least user friendly process to exchange your own money, far too many hurdles you have to get past to make a simple money transfer. Even after getting past all the hurdles you are restricted with a min and I believe a max amount of your own money you have access to, not to mention time restrictions; I wasn't able to access my money past midnight multiple times.

The recent update is broken. It diesn't allow to take screen shots (which by it self is not a problem) and the share button of a transaction doesn't work nor it will download the transaction receipt. I know security is especially important for banking systems but such a huge limitations on functionality will not serve the app any good. I guess the super app is the way to go.,2,2025-02-21,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store,NEGATIVE,0.999530553817749

"The app suffers from severe performance issues, particularly with response times. The backend seems to have high latency, as the OTP generation and delivery process consistently delays, even after the server acknowledges that it has been sent. API requests frequently fail, returning non-descriptive error messages that lack proper exception handling, making it difficult for users to understand the issue.

The best one of the internet banking apps I've come across in Ethiopia. Only thing I would like to see added is the ability to get a receipt after the payment has been payed or transferred.

"Even though I am a long-time Dashen Bank admirer, I find this app hard to use compared to other banks' mobile apps.

I will improve my rating once problems are addressed.",1,2023-11-22,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store,NEGATIVE,0.9978729486465454
"It is simple to use, one annoying thing is, it demands you to change passward frequently and then, when we get confused which passward we used last time, it locks you out, if you put wrong passward and then tells to go to your bank, which may be miles away.
