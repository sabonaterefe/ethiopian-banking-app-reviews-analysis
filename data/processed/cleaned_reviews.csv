"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.",2,2025-05-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"this new update(Mar 19,2025) is great in fixing bugs, stability and smooth experience I'll give u that but it came with a big shortcoming which is not allowing to take screenshot. I can't screenshot neither my balance nor the transaction or anything within the app, i understand it's for security reasons but please bring that back, allow us to take screenshot we need that. Thanks.",4,2025-03-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Good job to the CBE team on this mobile app! It's designed in a way that's simple and intuitive to navigate, which is great for everyone. It effectively handles the essential banking tasks I need to perform regularly. It's a practical and reliable tool that makes everyday banking much more convenient. Thank you for this useful application.",5,2025-04-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"everytime you uninstall the app you have to reach them out physically. very oldy! if that's one of security layer, they'd check for fraud attempt via app source directly(source:- app store, play store ... etc) implicitly ! we are in 2025, physical presence for every app install is traditional(traditionally very rare).",1,2025-06-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
as if the update of march 19 i can't take a screenshot in the app. i can just save it as file and that is so annoying. i used to save all screenshot in my gallery in one folder now with the extra steps added i have to save the file go to file and then screenshot it. the solution is to allow the screenshot to be save in to gallery automatically. i wish you give this review attention and resolve the issue shortly.,2,2025-03-19,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Old version was very friendly to use. Now we can't see the #Reason The #transaction history (very limited) and now it crash every time it's opened. More over, the last update prevents us from taking #screenshots. Thanks for the developers as they are getting more stupid than ever.",1,2025-03-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
Taking away the screenshot of the receipt is just silly. Worse is tbe download button putting a copy of the screenshot - which you prevented to be taken - in tbe downloads folder where we cant attach directly from Whatsapp. Millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment / transfer yet you make that harder for everyone? I have every user contacts the developer or manager who made this awful decision.,1,2025-03-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Recently there is big problem when sending to safaricom, telebir, and even to cbebirr wallet could anybody who is responsible fix it, it's very frustrating it's been 5 days and my money hasn't been returned it takes it out of my account but doesn't send it to my mpesa update- they have just corrected it and sent me back the money but still I'm afraid now to send again",2,2025-05-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"I’ve been using the CBE mobile banking app, and overall, I appreciate its features. However, I’ve noticed that when I turn on the developer options on my device, the app stops functioning properly.

"In the previous, I gave 4 🌟 for this app based on my evaluation. This app was without biometric security and may be exposed to cheaters unexpectedly. It is solved now. You can add verification security on the setting app. But there is something problem still with verification. It must prevent logging in without correct input fingerprint.",5,2024-12-20,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"my first frequent experience of cbe app is critical-time failure such as suspending payment on air for 2-5 days with zero explanation, deducting from sender account without depositing to the receiver act. Another fatal error by the banking company as a whole (not the app itself though) is forced-banking with corporations without consent of employers-users of the corresponding corporations",2,2025-04-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
What an absolutely terrible update. No screenshots and you still have this stupid restriction on developer options. WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOPERS!!!!!! At this point telebirr just wins the game 100%. CBE. Do. Better!,1,2025-03-21,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"First this app was pretty good and well connection while transferring money, but now there's no such a worst mob app ever while transferring money it corrupts due to the network and took the amount of money you were transferring from your account then after seconds interruptions it's shows that the money is transferred (this case happens especially to telebirrr wallet) then after you report the issue to the CBE customer service they refund your money to your CBE account after 3-5 days.",2,2025-01-09,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
Two step verification update is fake (meaningless). Why because the app gives you an option of to use pin while requesting two step verification step. 🔐 This updated app is not differ than the previous one in case of security & safegaurding users.👹👹💀💀 The other features of the app are best and easy to use it.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,1,2025-03-06,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
Really! this app is more simple to use at any time in every where also it's transaction quality between the users within the transaction receipt as abank that means this app is our bank on hand in mobile frankly I proud on this bank digital. I have no word to wrote ...... but it's have weakness on poor connection.,5,2025-03-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app is full of bugs here and there, perhaps it's from the backend side idk. For instance the transaction history you see on top is one made a couple of months ago and you have to refresh until you reach the top. it's just so bizarre. And you can't even search for a transaction you made. Someone with a lot of transactions will find it annoying. Even simple things like localising dates to Amharic dates are now correctly implemented.",2,2025-02-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
It made life alot easier. I cant even imagine having to make all those transactions in person. So this app was crucial for me. Very good app. well done.,5,2025-04-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
It used to be the best bank app in Ethiopia. But now using it is a terrible experience. For every transaction it shows an error message. Making a simple payment requires 5 to 6 trials to complete.,1,2025-01-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
I'm sad guys what are you doing? Why did you add the screenshot restriction to the app? You just made it worse it was a great value to us. You need to rethink it. i will change the 1 star rating when you resolve the issue.,1,2025-03-22,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
it was good app but it have some issues like it doesnt give me the right amount that I have in the bank and have some issues in transferring,2,2025-06-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

always disappointing ! especially the iOS one !! some similar local applications are extremely superior to this application!! Really disappointing!,1,2025-05-17,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"As an app developer, I rely on Developer Mode to build and test apps, but this app blocks access entirely if it's enabled. This restriction is unnecessary and makes it impossible for developers to use the service. Instead of outright blocking, consider implementing enhanced security measures that don't alienate professionals who need this setting. Please reconsider this policy.",2,2024-12-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
it is good app. But you have integrate cbe with cbe birr. to allow cardless withdrawal directly from our accout!,4,2025-03-31,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
Doesn't work properly. It crashes some many times. commercial bank of Ethiopia not only the application but also sending money to own CBE birr doesn't get your money in your bank account. forcefully you must wait 3-5 days to get your money back to your account. walk up CBE the world is going to decentralized finance.,1,2025-03-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I am not exaggerating when I say that this application is one of the biggest players in the banking industry. It has simplified a lot of things for the user, even if the bank is in his pocket. But my opinion is (1), when we transfer money, there is a word limit on the (Note) at the end. Why can't we write our reason briefly? I don't understand why it is limited. On the other hand, there is no limit on the bank. Could you explain this? (2), when we pay for water, why is the code not mentioned",5,2025-03-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"Add customer service please other than calling 951. Why would you have a mobile app but not an online text-based customer service? Why? Disappointing And I will never use the top-up feature again, I have been trying to recharge my safaricom balance but your app would say time out and then credit my account but never recharge my balance, why? Where is my money? Do you expect me to call 951 at midnight?",2,2025-02-08,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Why on earth is CBE telling me to turn off developer mode? As the name clearly states, it's for developers, not for CBE to dictate. There are countless financial apps out there that work just fine without demanding such an unnecessary restriction. If your app can’t handle developer mode, that’s a you problem. Fix your code instead of disabling features that have absolutely nothing to do with you.",2,2025-01-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I really like this app as it is being updated from time to time and includes multiple payment options. In particular, giving a receipt makes it even more preferable. However, when it is refreshed, it does not show the history of credit and deposit in order and, I am of the opinion that it is better if the recent history is fixed respectively according to the transaction date in the future because there is a problem of confusion.",3,2024-09-12,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The previous version is much better than this one. I used it for more than six years without any problem. But now I'm having a serious trouble with the updated app. I don't know why it takes him forever to refresh and load the home page once you sign in. And if it fails to load, it never recovers. I only see some UI changes. Really disappointed",2,2021-01-01,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"I like the application very much because it is user friendly and makes transactions easiest, especially for business matters. But, these few days I faced difficulties of opening it.

"It's a great app. I've been using this app since the bank launched it. As a long-term user, I would like to point out things that need to be improved. 1. Deleting money transfer history should be the user's choice. 2. There should be an option to download an in-depth transfer history for each transfer activity , just as there is posiblity to download a single time transfer recit. Do that and get 5 star.",3,2022-03-18,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"This app has several issues based on my experience. Below are the problems that I encountered: 1. The app frequently crashes. 2. It only shows a limited transaction record history (25 transactions). 3. You can't access the transaction records after 8:00 pm and on Sundays. 4. It displays a ""payment failed"" message. It would be greatly appreciated if you could address these issues",1,2024-08-25,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
1 star because I have to visit my bank for new installation of the app and reactivation takes about 45 to 60 minutes with there long queue and system failures. Learn from telebire app and give options to customers to apt out of this ridiculous security feature. Second why is there no customization in the settings for displaying which account I want displayed in the first section rather that slide to my main account every time. You are making us pay a monthly subscription. Bare minimum is not it,1,2025-02-26,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.",2,2020-09-03,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Application UI and new features are better than the previous version. I found a minor bugs though. I couldn't transfer to an account from the beneficiary list, it says None Available; There is still so much to do with the localization; Instead of ሰኔ it says ጁን and more like this; date conversion is missing also. If this minor things are fixed it will be much better.",3,2020-11-05,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"It is a good and progressive app through the updates. I think the app should further solve its bugs like 1. It doesn't download or share attachment on android 12 and 11, it used to work on android 10. 2. Sometimes transactions seem like they have failed and there are no records, but the transactions actually have passed this is a very serious issue, because people will try the transaction again which will end up doubling the payment.",4,2022-09-15,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"With each update the app is getting slower and slower, specially when requesting transaction history. And I wish the logging process could be done easily. When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the ""Own telebirr"" option. It id very limiting now a days",4,2023-08-11,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

"The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.",2,2024-09-04,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"The app is awesome. But there are many things to highlight.For example, When spending money from the account , a confirmation text message must be sent to the account holder. Also the fact that, the PIN is only four digits is not safe enough for security, if it is more than eight digits and includes numbers and symbols, it will be cool.",3,2023-01-29,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store
"Still needs development on several features.... For example - bank statements available online. The text feature of available balance and debited/credited notifications is very old school and involves too much digital trail. App doesn't always work, could be due to network issues in Ethiopia though. Another major issue is an error message is displayed when transferring from CBE to other banks. Ive almost lost a few thousands doing this once. Always cross check your balances.",1,2024-08-27,Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,Google Play Store

Very unprofessional and mischievous bank in my opinion. I have had several occasions but recently I used Abyssinia Card to withdraw money and it was deducted from my account but despite reporting several times they said they are processing it but I learned yesterday that since it has been 3 months the bank has decided to include it in their income.

"Worst app possible, I don't think it gets worse than this. Least user friendly process to exchange your own money, far too many hurdles you have to get past to make a simple money transfer. Even after getting past all the hurdles you are restricted with a min and I believe a max amount of your own money you have access to, not to mention time restrictions; I wasn't able to access my money past midnight multiple times. You can't change tab to another app, having opened this without it crashing.",1,2025-05-15,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"Requires updates too frequently, often has server related issues, the fingerprint always requires updating, it's the most unreliable app I've used and always fails when you want to make urgent payments.",2,2025-04-10,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
The recent update is broken. It diesn't allow to take screen shots (which by it self is not a problem) and the share button of a transaction doesn't work nor it will download the transaction receipt. I know security is especially important for banking systems but such a huge limitations on functionality will not serve the app any good. I guess the super app is the way to go.,2,2025-02-21,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
Very slow and it seems that every update something else is not working. The latest update doesn't allow me to use biometrics anymore and maximum daily transfer to Telebirr is 5k?!,1,2025-02-04,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"The UI/UX experience is already good, but some minor tweaks in font sizes and color can take it to the top-notch level. Imagine the sheer joy and satisfaction your users will feel when they see the polished and refined interface you've created for them. Don't miss the opportunity to impress them even more with these simple yet impactful changes.",5,2024-03-12,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
disappointed because of option to transfer cash on telebirr is limited for self only.... those and other similar given choices by the bank used us to choose this bank over others! no doubt I will be not preferring this bank with no unique incentives.,1,2025-03-29,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"The app suffers from severe performance issues, particularly with response times. The backend seems to have high latency, as the OTP generation and delivery process consistently delays, even after the server acknowledges that it has been sent. API requests frequently fail, returning non-descriptive error messages that lack proper exception handling, making it difficult for users to understand the issue. I know you will gonne say""ehe yedekem hzb teche alteche"", but that it.",1,2024-09-12,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
Both Amole & Dashen superApp are by far the worst mobile banking apps i have ever came across. if only there is 0 star option,1,2025-03-18,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"The security, cool, every time OTP!! The UI, let's not talk about the UI, But how the heck it says ""offline mode is not available"" something like that, when I enter more than the max amount to transfer. Fellas i am a web dev, this is bad UX. It needs update on the UX. Will see the UI later.",3,2024-09-10,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
The best one of the internet banking apps I've come across in Ethiopia. Only thing I would like to see added is the ability to get a receipt after the payment has been payed or transferred. Since it only gives a receipt right at the moment of payment and after that there is no way to get a receipt.,5,2023-11-08,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"It is nice app, secure. The problem is, it can not remember accounts I have previously transferred to. I have to manually enter account number every time I want to make transfers. The CBE app remembers previously used accounts. Learn from them.",4,2022-12-09,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"Even though I am a long-time Dashen Bank admirer, I find this app hard to use compared to other banks' mobile apps. It has a problem refreshing account balance, I needed to log out and login to see the updated account balance. Overall, user friendliness of the app needs a serious upgrade. I will improve my rating once problems are addressed.",1,2023-11-22,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"It is simple to use, one annoying thing is, it demands you to change passward frequently and then, when we get confused which passward we used last time, it locks you out, if you put wrong passward and then tells to go to your bank, which may be miles away. Please make the frequency of passward change less frequent.",2,2023-06-06,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"Aside of some of it's major flows, the worst one yet is that it doesn't give you the full detail of your transaction history. Like the receiver's name and account number. You've to take a screenshot to document it or send it to the receiver as a confirmation.",2,2023-09-02,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"I like the fact that it sends you a SMS message every time your log in to the application. So if a malicious user access my account, I know straight away. This feature is unique. Excellent job Dashen!",4,2022-08-11,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"The app is extremely slow, often stuck on the logo. Security is poor, requiring only username/password. This allows unauthorized transactions. A large company like yours needs stronger security, such as two-factor authentication. The app's speed lags significantly compared to others. Numerous updates are needed to improve performance and security. Currently, it's a frustrating and time-wasting experience.",1,2025-01-03,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store

"Very poor service, always not responding when ever we need to transfer I rate it 0 !",1,2025-02-23,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
"Much better than the Amole app, but still needs some improvements. On the transfer screen, the type of transfers' names are missing. Also some of fonts look faded.",4,2022-09-14,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
There is always room for improvement and an opportunity to adopt! keep improving and keep evolving. I would love to see external services provided by the Amole app to utilize and actively operate our banking account. Option to invest in ideas that could build Ethiopian creativity. Yosef ke Dallas,4,2023-11-22,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
Account is locked out without any wrong password retries 3 times. Sending OTP is unnecessary because it has its own username and password.we can not make transfer without having SIM card on hands.if it require SIM card why we not use USSD no need of app instead .it makes discomfort for using,3,2023-03-20,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store

What I like about Amole is it send otp for every transaction and make your transaction more secure. But it will be more secure if you make otp only via SMS.,5,2022-09-07,Dashen Bank,Google Play Store
